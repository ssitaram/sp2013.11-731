her critics demanded , kagan refused a hearing on this case , because it was too involved in the law 's protection then , in order to be impartial now .

" asia might be to some degree is protected , but it could not be invulnerable . "
the european monetary union was heavily undermined by the european debt crisis management in the last few months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis spawned fears that he once again lead the global economy to recession , and has led to calls for leading emerging economies come together to help the eurozone to find the solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that will " , to help the euro , as its own economy is now declining exports and foreign capital inflows .
" we have a grandiose objectives , and we must maintain a high level of growth " .
others assert that for emerging economies like india makes no sense to help rich europeans , when they are faced with their own deep economic problems .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers monday in congress , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction from pentagon corridors to fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry of , " panetta said in a letter to the senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine trust , those who supports our army and will do serious damage combat readiness . "
" while not directly affected military funding overseas contingency operations секвестром , military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff would be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be disrupted . "
" consequences of sequestration in the ministry of defense will be rapid decline of the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with whom we can live together , and this is not a solution , which we must impose . "
whether panetta a letter or the recent warnings senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for release the pentagon from reductions , will see later .
at a press conference last week , a defence minister painted a gloomy picture of what could be further -- troops with shell , but without the kernel .
" this is a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained troops , able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in their introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects may face obstacles , including those that have already been testing and some the early stages of planning .
end further development and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that is a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats and china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines demonstrates how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in their everyday lives .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , since they allegedly hide that retired football coach raped kids .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged with in financial fraud during the campaign that associated with укрывательством extramarital affairs .
history about the fraud on the exams in the school and college - standard thing .
mentors , who should teach the opposite , sends a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
during one day , as the research shows , you can lie from the 10 % to 200 times .
another study showed that unfamiliar people солгали three times for the first 10 minutes meeting with one another .
unlike room games , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research project , especially on psychology and physiology .
not out of this it is difficult to draw the conclusion that liars notice and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which it is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviews , negotiating or management .
we know from studies that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , then as women -- more about other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe behind the asphyxia , the laughter , voice characteristics in your facility .
rats can fix the top of his body , when trying to recall their history , they can to put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in the speech : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated issue entirely .
someone can use the " language " , when the complex question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... how i know . "
there is no magic to detect lies , but to master the skill detecting deception .

in its programme in francois hollande was confined to platitudes , saying " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей recent data immigration ( special people : how migration shaped our world and will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , 352 . ) , among specialists there is broad consensus about the positive impact of migration flows , wages and employment growth in countries that accept immigrants .
fears of the immigrants based on the view that they are able to replace the local workers , especially skilled , provoking reduced wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most skilled in vibrant sectors , where training is not with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be difficult to work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов complementarity , existing between local and immigrants , leads to the arrival of immigrants that positively affects wages local workers .
and this is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates high share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all on immigrants ) .
according to the organization of labor , in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus costs ) an average of 150,000 euros .

democracy is a valuable purchasing ; but also simultaneously and fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , to arrange a vote and make it so directly as possible .

we do n't win , demanding series of national referenda , organized as required and хаотическом manner .
no , we are dreaming not edge the guillotine , but implementation of - the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , at this time at the european level .
all europe completely subject to dictates markets and rating agencies , is suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about transfer of sovereignty europe , but the entire europe gradually lose its sovereignty , and with her each of its nations .
because only collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt each , from the markets and prepare for future by investing in it .
after a long discussion of this supply socialists , and jacques delors everything now require a european economic government .
but to submit its own without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in граздан , is another madness and a stalemate .
in order to establish the republic in france was to " establish a " republicans .
this can be done only by creating a more democratic european at the political level , present popular eu sovereignty .

among the wreckage , the remaining after the operation , french and нигерские investigators have found a few telephone sim cards that belonged to terrorists .
analysis occurred calls pointed to several interlocutors , in the , mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but clearly , we should wait for more reliable evidence , before we talk about operational cooperation between boko haram and aqmi . "
" for many years , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more active , " says кунле амуво , nigeria researcher .
