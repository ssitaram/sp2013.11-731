defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress , warning that the automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and to civil assembly .
" the effects of these cuts would be devastating to , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham of south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong decline , the majority of our projects кораблестроению and construction of the unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and will seriously damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the trust of those who support our own army and will do severe damage to the combat readiness . "
" although the foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .

a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and the повсеместны deceit and lies in their everyday lives .
the administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged with лжесвидетельствовании , because they were allegedly made that the retired retired football coach raped young boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards has been charged in the financial fraud during the campaign , relating to укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud in the exams in high school and college , is the norm .
guides , which have to teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are appropriate .
during one of the day , studies have shown that , then you can lie from the 10 to 200 times .
another study found that total strangers солгали or three times for the first 10 minutes of each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " to lie is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the most prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
is not part of this hard to notice and it 's hard to draw the conclusion that the liars .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn how to identify lies - and that helps in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts , and that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lie to its partners , less than the unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe behind позой , laughing , the voice of your subject .
rats can secure the top of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can to put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with that woman miss lewinsky " or to repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone can use the language , " when answers the question : " well ... the truth . . . as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magic , to expose the lies , but the skill of deception detection can be .

if there is the subject , a decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion , or under the influence of emotion , so it 's an energy policy .
this is a trend , that the electoral meeting place , and are an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their own opinion on the objective facts and the sound .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production is , not forgetting the critical need to cut greenhouse gas emissions , to deal with climate imbalances - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
that is the reason why germany is one in his or her decision to abandon the nuclear energy .
on the other hand , the great britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , is only a few of those who strongly to their projects .
although the model , germany , based on renewable energy , and sometimes cited as an example , the reality is this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which it gets 30 % of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas прерывистого wind ; because of the carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the service of industrial equipment to the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from low - cost electricity in europe .

then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) , he said that " do not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides of the see immigration as a burden for the french economy , and to french society .
in his program of francois hollande was platitudes , saying that " collaboration will help to solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей last data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on the economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears of the immigrants are based on the view that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking lower wages .
unskilled immigrants work in the sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified in the dynamic sectors , where training has to do with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there are a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity between local and immigrants , leads to the arrival of immigrants that positively affects the wages of workers .
and it is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among the american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all based on immigrants ) .

universal vote , though , and is a necessary condition for democracy , is not a sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as when a republican philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , we are experiencing , " it 's an economic crisis , but in the first is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win , for a series of national referenda , anything by as necessary and хаотическом .
no , we dream , but not on the edge of guillotine on the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - on and democracy , this time the pan - european level .
all of europe as a whole to the dictates of markets and rating agencies suffer from their weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty , europe , but the entire europe was gradually losing their sovereignty , and each of the nations along with it .
because only together the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of the debt each , free markets and prepare for future by investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this offer and jacques delors all socialists now require that the european economic government .
but to represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in life , граздан , is a madness and a dead end .
