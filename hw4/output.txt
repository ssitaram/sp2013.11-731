the european monetary union was heavily undermined by the european debt crisis management in the last few months .
in the europe debt crisis has given rise to fears that he once again lead the global economy to recession , and has led to calls for leading developing economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything , that will be able " to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now slowing exports and reduced inflows of foreign capital .

secretary of defense leon panetta tempers on monday in congress , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the ministry of " , " panetta said in a letter to the senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong reduction , the majority of our projects on кораблестроению and construction unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and will do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the trust of those who support our own army and will do severe damage to the combat readiness . "
" even though military financing in the foreign emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , military , to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" the staff personnel will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям with payments military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be compromised . "
" the consequence of the sequestration in the ministry of defense will become the fastest decline in the united states as a world 's leading military power " .

whether the recent warnings senators or a letter to panetta will lead to budget a compromise or strengthen calls for release of the pentagon from cuts , will see later .
at a press conference last week 's defence minister painted a gloomy picture of what may be followed by further -- troops from the shell , but without the core .
" it 's a paper tiger , the army with the barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers , who can accomplish the mission , " panetta said in their introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects can face obstacles , including those that have already been tested , and some of the only in the early stages of planning .

a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows how much are serious and повсеместны deception and lies in the everyday life .
the administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged with лжесвидетельствовании , because they were allegedly made that the retired retired football coach raped young boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial fraud during the campaign , connected with the укрывательством fornication ties .
stories about the fraud in the tests in a school and college - it 's the usual thing .
mentors , who should be to teach the opposite , they send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
in one of the day , studies have shown that , you may lie from 10 % up to 200 times .
another study showed that the unfamiliar people солгали three times in the first 10 minutes online dating with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
should not be out of this draw the conclusion that liars it is difficult to see and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that detection of lies - modern skill , which it is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- particularly if your professional duties include recruiting , interviews , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts , and that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lie to its partners , less than the unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe per asphyxia , laughter , the voice characteristics of the your object .
rats can secure the top of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can to put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , change its position in a certain way , or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or to repeat a complicated question entirely .
someone can use the " qualification language " , when answering a difficult question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know . . . as far as i know . "
there is no magical funds , to expose the lie , but to master the skill detection of deception can be .

модоло , as рольдан and байона with experience in the city building , called the proposal " intellectual challenge " with " some of the risks " .
first fear is this is the restriction of the borders , where it is possible to build .
" we need to think about the new urban planning tools , because the current [ as for the general capital plan ( gsp ) ] can lead to a real trouble . "
модоло recalls that already has a work made outside кальсеролы , which " should not miss deaf ears , " even though he 's grateful for the opportunity , which city hall offers his profession , to join the project , " from the beginning . "
байона hints that answer the question , which sets the name of this part of the complex , as in the rules of the contest lacks a common type of кольсеролы : " it was announced 16 intersecting contests , " he says , " within the meaning of the sea - mountain , but there are no buckling reading , to see and understand the region as a whole . "
on the other hand , the project for some , the gate can cross the program and the definition of the project architect for neighboring gate .

this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said an expert in the area of chemical engineering .
among the most of the upper layers is bitumen , compiled by the small stones , опущенных in the bitumen and then the спрессованных .
a movement of the vehicles and latch effort , this helps the forces very well be on the road to cover .
the асфальтовом cover , he added , put the last layer , which is called the wear and tear , which is made of small stone , in fact , the sand as well as immersed in the asphalt .
as part of pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , a layer of wear and tear also requires the proper thickness , and it is necessary to take into account material , from whom he is .

if there is a topic , a decision on which cannot be taken after the short discussion on or under the influence of emotions , so it is an energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that the election meetings are an occasion for thinking about the share of and place , their nuclear power .
france needs to be to build their views on the objective facts and on the rational data .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production all the time , not forgetting about the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalances - theme , which has disappeared from the environmental debate .
that is the reason why germany is one in his or her decision to abandon the nuclear energy .
on the other hand , great britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , is only a few of those , who strongly continues to their projects .
while the model of germany , based on the renewable energy , sometimes as an example of the , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which it receives a 30 % of its electricity , it 's as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices 65 per cent , respectively , and 50 % higher than the average for europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french company benefiting from low - cost electricity in europe .
price , a majority of the french refuse to pay , the more so , because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy .

both sides of the see immigration burden to the french economy and for french of the society .
in his program francois hollande was confined to platitudes , saying that " the joint work will help to solve our immigration . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей recent data about immigration ( special people : how migration shaped our world and will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , wage and employment in the countries that are immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in the sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified in the dynamic sectors , where training has to do with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , between local and immigrants , has led to that with the arrival of immigrants positively affect wages local workers .
and this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all immigrants are based ) .

the european crisis that we are experiencing , " this is the economic crisis , but the first of all it is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we 'll win nothing , demanding a series of national referendums , organized by as the need and in хаотическом order .
there is no , we are dreaming not of the blade the guillotine , but on the implementation of the " joint , the clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
all of europe as a whole to the dictates of markets , and rating agencies , suffers from his weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty europe , but the whole of europe entirely gradually losing its sovereignty , and with it , each of its nations .
because only joint work of europeans will be able to reduce the severity of the debt each , free from markets and prepare for the future , by investing in him .
after a long discussion this proposal the socialists and jacques delors all now , require the european economic government .
but to represent it without more strong economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in the life граздан , is another madness and a new dead end .
