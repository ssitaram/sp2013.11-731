defense secretary leon panetta tempers on monday in congress , warning that the automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon to fields of battle in afghanistan , on the line and civil assembly .
" the effects of these cuts will be damaging for ministry , " panetta said in a letter to the senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , make such a strong contraction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and would seriously damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will damage alert ' .
" although military financing in the foreign emergency operations not directly affected секвестром , military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff personnel will be reduced , would lead to опозданиям with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be compromised " .
" consequences of sequestration in the ministry of defense will be the rapid decline in the united states as a leading global military powers . "
" this is not an option , with which we can live together , and it is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta a letter or the recent warnings senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for release the pentagon from reductions , will see later .
at a press conference last week , secretary of defense painted a gloomy picture of what could be further -- troops from the shell , but without a core .
" this is a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained troops can accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory comments at the pentagon .

a cursory glance at recent headlines demonstrates how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in their everyday lives .

history about fraud in the tests in the school and college - standard deal .
guides that must teach the opposite , sent a message that lies and fraud are appropriate .
within one day , as studies show that , you can lie from the 10 to 200 times .
another study has shown that unfamiliar people солгали three times in the first 10 minutes and get acquainted with each other .
unlike in the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research project , especially psychology and physiology .
not worth it from that draw the conclusion that liars to see and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that detection of lies - modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interview , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , lied to its partners that married people less than unmarried ( but the lie , which they say , often наглая . )
observe behind the позой , laugh , voice of your facility .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet toward the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in the speech : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated issue entirely .
someone can use the " qualification language " , when answering the complicated issue : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill of fraud detection .

fears of impact of immigrants based on the view that they are able to replace local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking decrease in wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , but the most skilled - dynamic sectors , where training not associated with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity , between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect wages local workers .
and this is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) .

but to her without stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in life граздан , is another frenzy and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , should have " create a " republicans .
this may only be done through the establishment of a more democratic europe the political level , present popular european sovereignty .
