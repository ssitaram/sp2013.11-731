her critics , demanded that kagan refused a hearing on this case because she was too involved in the protection of the law , then , to be impartial now .

" asia can be up to some extent is protected , but she may not be invulnerable .
the european monetary union was heavily undermined by the european debt crisis management in the last few months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis spawned fears that he once again lead the global economy to recession , and has led to calls for leading emerging economies come together to help the eurozone to find the solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that will " , to help the euro , as its own economy is now declining exports and foreign capital inflows .
" we have a grandiose objectives , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others assert that for emerging economies like india makes no sense to help rich europeans , when they are faced with their own deep economic problems .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers monday in congress , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction from pentagon corridors to fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry of , " panetta said in a letter to the senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine trust , those who supports our army and will do serious damage combat readiness . "
" although military financing in the foreign emergency operations not directly affected секвестром , military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff would be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be disrupted . "
" consequence of sequestration in the ministry of defence will be the rapid decline in the united states as a leading global military power . "
" this is not an option , with whom we can live together , and this is not a solution , which we must impose . "
whether panetta a letter or the recent warnings senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for release the pentagon from reductions , will see later .
at a press conference last week , a defence minister painted a gloomy picture of what could be further -- troops with shell , but without the kernel .
" this is a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained troops , able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in their introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects may face obstacles , including those that have already been testing and some the early stages of planning .
ending further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say , that is a vital next step , to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines demonstrates how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in their everyday lives .
administration at the university of pennsylvania , was charged in лжесвидетельствовании because they allegedly hide that schlensker retired football coach raped boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged with in financial fraud during the campaign that associated with укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about fraud at exams in high school and college - standard affair .
mentors , who should be taught the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
during one day , as the research shows , you can lie from the 10 % to 200 times .
another study showed that unfamiliar people солгали three times for the first 10 minutes meeting with one another .
unlike in the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " identifying lies is a serious direction of knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not worth the draw the conclusion that the liars difficult to see and it is hard to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which it is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviews , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , lied to its partners that married people less than unmarried ( but the lie , which they say , often наглая . )
watch asphyxia laughter , voice characteristics to your object .
rats can fix the top of his body , when trying to recall their history , they can to put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in the speech : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated issue entirely .
someone can use the " language " , when the complex question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... how i know . "
there is no magic to detect lies , but to master the skill detecting deception .

as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей recent data the immigration people ( special : how migration shaped our world and will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , among specialists there is broad consensus about the positive impact of migration flows , wages and employment growth in countries that accept immigrants .

unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most skilled in vibrant sectors , where training is not with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity , between local and immigrants , leads to that the arrival of the immigrants positively affect wages local workers .

all of europe entirely subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from her weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty europe , but all of europe entirely gradually loses its sovereignty , and each of its nations along with it .

to establish a republic in france , should have " create a " republicans .
