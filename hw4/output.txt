" staff personnel will be reduced , causing опозданиям with military suppliers and legal and political support will be broken . "

stories of fraud on exams in school and college is the norm .
mentors who must teach the opposite , sent a message that as lies and fraud .
in one day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times in the first 10 minutes of each other .
in contrast to the games room , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " to lie is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades of prestigious universities in comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not from this hard to notice and it is difficult to draw the conclusion that liars .
i spent a few years , the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and help in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men are more about yourself , whereas women -- the other , usually to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe позой , laughing , voice of your target .
rats can secure the top of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet toward the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all complicated questions behind .
привирающие people can also use disengagement in the speech : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat the question entirely . ...
someone can use the language " when responding to a question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as i know . "
there is no magic means to identify , but the skill can detect deception .

if there is a topic that the decision which cannot be taken after a short discussion or by emotions , so it 's energy policy .
this healthy trend that the election meetings are an occasion for reflection on share and place their nuclear energy .
france should build their opinion on the objective facts and rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete fossil resources to continue electricity production is growing deficit , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate imbalances - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
why germany is one in his decision to abandon nuclear power .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil is just a few of those who resolutely keeps his projects .
while the german model based on renewable energy , sometimes for example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and 50 % higher than average in europe .
as the price of energy is a key factor in a globalized economy competitiveness and service of industrial equipment in the national territory , the french company benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that most french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a плеяду specialized on international trade in small and medium enterprises and create many jobs that cannot be moved into another industry .
one engineer and electrician would order epr , calculated to sixty years , if a planned closure of its maker ?
areva solutions low carbon development , nuclear and renewable energy sources , indicating взаимодополнимости .
france we have security body , which monitors energy edged and transparent centers such as фламанвиль .
for 50 years , the nuclear industry has three serious incidents .
in chernobyl reactor and unforgivable mistake led to the tragedy .
the nuclear industry benefit from this accident , learned from previous two .

then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news , when interior minister ( либерасьон " from france on may 23 , said that " does not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see the burden for the french economy and immigration for french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows , wages and employment growth in countries that accept immigrants .
fears by immigrants based on the view that they can replace local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking lower wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and most skilled , dynamic sectors , where training not related to the proposals .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in a country where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity between local that the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and without taking into account the fact that this diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates high proportion of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all founded immigrants ) .
according to labor organization , for example , in a german immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring state budget net profit ( revenue minus costs an average of 150,000 euros .

no , we are dreaming not лезвии guillotine , but on the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on level .
europe completely follow the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers its weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about transfer europe , but the whole europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with each of her nations .
because only europeans to work can reduce the severity of debt each , free markets and prepare for future investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal and jacques all socialists now require european economic government .
but to her without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in граздан , is another madness and new .
to establish the republic of france was to " create " republicans .
this could only be done by a more democratic europe on the political level , this european sovereignty .

after iraq did not believe in a military intervention , which увязают in the sand .
the north stream , new gates for russian gas to europe .
he is the supply of gas equivalent of 30 million households .
more than 500 guests , including four heads of state and participated in last tuesday on the shores of the baltic sea , between orchestra and exquisite performance snack , in the opening of the nord stream , new pipeline that directly links russia and germany under water .
on a new pipeline 27.5 million additional cubic meters of gas will come every year in western europe for the first 1 224 km long pipeline connecting the leningrad region , the mecklenburg - western pomerania .

these two countries will lose part of its power : they will be harder to influence russia threatening to shut down access to western european markets .
europe but the price of energy because it created the gap between eastern and western europe .
