" while not directly affected military funding overseas contingency operations секвестром , military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff personnel will be reduced , causing опозданиям with military suppliers and legal and political support will be broken . "
" the sequestration in the ministry of defence will be rapid decline in the united states as a leading global military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option that we should impose " .
whether panetta letter or recent warnings senators will lead to pentagon budget compromise or inflame calls for release from cutbacks , see later .
at a news conference last week defense secretary painted a gloomy picture of what could be further -- troops with puppetry , but without the core .
" this paper tiger , the army barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers , to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks at the pentagon .

a cursory glance at recent headlines shows how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly made retired football coach raped boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged with financial during the campaign укрывательством , extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on exams in school and college is the norm .
mentors who must teach the opposite , sent a message that as lies and fraud .
in one day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study that strangers солгали three for the first 10 minutes with each other .
unlike games room , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research project , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not from this difficult to conclude that liars notice and difficult to expose .
i spent several years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which can easily learn and helps in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from studies that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about other , usually to protect someone 's feelings , lied to its partners that married people less than unmarried ( but the lie that they say , mostly наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can secure the top of his body when trying to remember its history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all complicated questions behind .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in speech : " i have n't had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat the question completely . ...
someone can use the " language " when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... how do i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magic means to identify , but the skill can detect deception .

germany , in turn , the growth of 0.5 % over the same period .
if there is a theme , the decision which cannot be taken after short discussion or influenced by emotions , so it 's energy policy .
this healthy trend that the election meetings are an occasion for reflection on share and place their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their opinion on objective facts and rational data .
during the same period will be necessary to complete fossil resources to continue electricity production is growing deficit , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate imbalances - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
why germany is one in his decision to abandon nuclear power .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , just few of those who resolutely keeps their projects .
although german model based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon emissions and electricity prices 65 % and 50 % respectively higher than average in europe .
as the price of energy is a key factor in a globalized economy competitiveness and service of industrial equipment in the national territory , the french company benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
price most french people refuse to pay more because they do not oppose in principle this kind of energy .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a плеяду specialized on international trade in small and medium enterprises and create many jobs that cannot be moved into another industry .
one engineer and electrician would order epr , calculated to sixty years , if a planned closure of its maker ?
areva solutions low carbon development , nuclear and renewable energy sources , indicating взаимодополнимости .
france we have security body , which monitors energy edged and transparent centers such as фламанвиль .
for 50 years atomic industry experienced three serious incident .
in the chernobyl reactor and unforgivable human error led to tragedy .
the nuclear industry benefit from this accident , learned from previous two .

then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news , when interior minister ( либерасьон " on may 23 ) stated that france " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration burden to the french economy and for french society .
in his program francois hollande was platitudes , saying that " collaboration will solve our immigration " .
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows , wages and employment growth in countries that accept immigrants .
fears of influence of immigrants based on the view that they can replace local workers , especially skilled , provoking lower wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and most skilled , dynamic sectors , where training not related to the proposals .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity between local and immigrants , leads that the immigrants positively affect wages local workers .
and it 's without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates is share naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all based immigrants ) .
labor organization estimates that in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , life will bring state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros .
these teeth who used to scare immigrants made precisely the opposite effect .

whole europe to dictates markets and rating agencies , suffers from his weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about transfer europe , but the whole europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with each of her nations .
because only europeans to work can reduce the severity of debt each , free markets and prepare for future investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal and jacques all socialists now require european economic government .
but to her without stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in граздан , is another madness and a stalemate .
to establish the republic , france needed to " create " republicans .
this can only be done by creating a more democratic europe the political level , this popular european sovereignty .

the international community led by washington now puts pressure on абуджу to attention problems , that creates the boko haram .
it focused mainly on the churches , bars and authorities .
last christmas she took on responsibility per share , in which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then another one in abuja .
local united nations office in august would become its first international goal .
today , when aqmi has in mali and niger , and somali from al-shabaab in kenya boko haram poses a new continent .
