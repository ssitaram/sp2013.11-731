Initially, I tried a rule based approach suggested in http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/P/P05/P05-1066.pdf which is to Reorder the input sentence so it has a target-like order, then use the baseline decoder. I parsed the input Spanish sentences using a Spanish parser from http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/visl/es/parsing/automatic/upload.php I processed the parsed results and came up with a rule to flip adjectives and nouns if the adjective modified the noun (by checking for agreement in gender, number) and re-ordered the input based on this rule. However, when I ran the baseline decoder, the results were worse than the baseline, so I gave up on this.
Then I created a syntax based decoder based on the CYK algorithm, which beat the baseline.

To run, python newdecode.py
